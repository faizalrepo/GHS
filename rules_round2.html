<h1>Round 2: The Ghostly Code Hunt - Debugging Challenge</h1>
<p class="round_rules">1.Debugging Challenge: In this round, participants will receive three code snippets, each containing a bug or error. These bugs may be logical, syntactical, or runtime errors.</p>
<p class="round_rules">2.Code Languages: The code snippets will be provided in one or more of the following languages: Python, C++, Java. Participants should debug the code in the language it is presented.</p>
<p class="round_rules">3.Debugging Tools: Participants may use any debugging tools or environments they prefer, including integrated development environments (IDEs) and debugging software.</p>
<p class="round_rules">4.Ghost Locations: Each code snippet, when debugged successfully, will produce a specific output. After submitting the output answer in the submit button , they will get the location of the ghost. Participants must correctly debug any one of the code snippets to reveal the complete ghost location.</p>
<p class="round_rules">5.Scoring: Participants will earn points based on the successful debugging of the code snippet. The points for each code snippet may vary based on the complexity of the bug.</p>
<p class="round_rules">6.Time Limit: Participants will have a set time limit to debug all three code snippets. The timer starts when the challenge is officially announced.</p>
<p class="round_rules">7.Code Submission: After debugging each code snippet, participants should submit their corrected code through a designated "Submit" button on the provided webpage. This submission is necessary to reveal the ghost locations.</p>
<p class="round_rules">8.Points will be given by the judges and will be updated on the dashboard</p>
<p class="round_rules">9.Disqualification: Teams that violate the rules or engage in any form of cheating or plagiarism will be disqualified from the competition.</p>
<p class="round_rules">10.Questions and Clarifications: Participants may seek clarifications or ask questions regarding the code snippets if needed. These questions should be directed to the organizers, and responses will be provided promptly.</p>
