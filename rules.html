<h1>Round 1: The Puzzling Entrance - Maze Challenge</h1>
<p class="round_rules">1.Programming Languages: Participants may choose to code in Python, C++, or Java to solve the maze problem. They should use their preferred integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other suitable environment.</p>
<p class="round_rules">2.Time Limit: Participants will have a total of 45 minutes to solve the maze problem. The timer starts when the challenge is officially announced.</p>
<p class="round_rules">3.Maze Challenge:The maze problem is provided in this webpage, describing the maze's structure, starting point, and destination. It will be available in three programming languages: Python, C++, and Java.</p>
<p class="round_rules">4.Solving the Maze: Participants must use their coding skills to develop a program that navigates through the maze and finds a solution. The program should take into account the maze's structure and constraints.</p>
<p class="round_rules">5.Code Submission:Once participants have successfully coded a solution, they should submit their code through a designated "Submit" button on the provided webpage. This submission is necessary to move on to the next round.</p>
<p class="round_rules">6.Evaluation:Submissions will be evaluated for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to the given programming language's syntax. The judges will assess whether the code successfully navigates the maze and reaches the destination.</p>
<p class="round_rules">7.Advancement to the Next Round: Only teams that successfully submit a working solution to the maze problem within the 45-minute time limit will be eligible to advance to the next round.</p>
<p class="round_rules">8.Disqualification:Teams that violate the rules or engage in any form of cheating or plagiarism will be disqualified from the competition.</p>
<p class="round_rules">9.Points will be given by the judges and will be updated on the dashboard.</p>
<p class="round_rules">10.Questions and Clarifications: Participants may seek clarifications or ask questions regarding the maze problem if needed. These questions should be directed to the organizers, and responses will be provided promptly.</p>
