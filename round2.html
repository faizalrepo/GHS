                    <p>The cryptic message, "trees of children's your eyes of fear close it when you see open she you calls," kept echoing in your mind as you examined the photograph. It depicted the parents standing near a tree adorned with eerie, cursed dolls.

With the information you had gathered, you embarked on a journey into the deep south side of the forest, about 3 kilometers from the main path. As you approached the location from the photograph, a sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air.

Standing near the ominous tree, your heart raced as you witnessed one of the cursed dolls suddenly falling to the ground. Panic coursed through you, but you swiftly recalled the message's instructions: "eyes of fear close it when you see it." Without hesitation, you tightly shut your eyes, waiting for what would happen next.

In the eerie silence that followed, you experienced a series of vivid and haunting images from the past. The house before you had once been home to a mother and her daughter. The mother had been strict, her expectations high, especially regarding her daughter's upcoming exams. Tragically, the daughter had fallen seriously ill on the day of the crucial test, leading her to fail. Consumed by guilt and despair, the young girl had taken her own life, and the mother had blamed herself for pushing her too hard. Unable to bear the pain of living without her child, the mother had resorted to spiritual rituals in an attempt to communicate with her deceased daughter.

Abruptly, the visions ceased, and the screams of the child snapped you back to the present. You opened your eyes to find yourself standing at the entrance of the mysterious house.

The haunted house stood before you, an enigma that no one in the town had ever dared to enter. Gathering your courage, you pushed open the creaking gate, its noise amplifying the eerie feeling that surrounded the garden.

With trepidation, you entered the garden, sensing the presence of something unsettling. You had no clear plan for how to search for the missing girl within the confines of this foreboding house. Suddenly, a piercing scream shattered the silence, emanating from one of the windows on the top floor.

Driven by urgency and determination, you raced inside the house. Climbing the shadowy stairs, you reached the top floor, where the door to the room with the window was slightly ajar. A strange, eerie glow emanated from within.

With every nerve on edge, you cautiously pushed the door open, revealing a room filled with flickering candles and an unsettling atmosphere. In the corner, you found the missing child, her face marked with exhaustion, tears streaming down her cheeks, and her cries for help growing louder by the moment. You had finally found her, but the mysteries of the house were far from over, and the answers you sought lay within its eerie confines.
